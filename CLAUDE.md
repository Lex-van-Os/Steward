# Code style and workflow

### Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing code:
- If available: Read and understand the linked issue and understand its acceptance criteria.
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask. 

### Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing extra that is speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.
- Make use of the KISS principle.

### Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.


When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- Prerequisites for changes: Every changed line should trace directly to the request that you were given.

### Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals. Examples:
- Input: "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass".
- Input: Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass".
- Input: "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after".

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## Use source control best practices
Make use of best practices when performing source control actions. Everything should be clear and concise.

When using source control:
- Don't just blindly commit changes. Commit when you have a coherent, reviewable unit of work.
- Make use of the Conventional Commits specification.
- When creating a pull request, make use of the pull request template that is found in the .github folder.
- Link the created pull request to the GitHub issue, and populate the pull request with a fitting fixes or closing statement.

These guidelines are working if: fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
